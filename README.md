Extrinsically calibrate multiple depth cameras.

This project can be used to extrinsically calibrate multiple depth cameras based on their view of a number of visible landmarks. The landmarks are black squares on a white background. The cameras should be all able to see each of the landmarks simultaneously to be able to find correspondences. The cameras should be arranged in a front, left and right position for optimal performance.
